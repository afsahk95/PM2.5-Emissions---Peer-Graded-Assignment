## Question 1:
## Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008?
## Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all
## sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

totalNEI <- aggregate(Emissions ~ year, NEI, sum)

plot(totalNEI$year, totalNEI$Emissions, type = "o", col = "steelblue3", main = expression("Total US "~ PM[2.5]~ "Emissions by Year"), ylab = expression("Total US "~   PM[2.5] ~ "Emissions"), xlab = "Year")
